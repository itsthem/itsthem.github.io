# it's them

We're a group of people dedicated to removing gendered language from open-source projects.

### Why?

1. It is important to be inclusive to non-binary people (and those who prefer different pronouns). Research shows that [it is possible to heavily decrease the suicide rates of transgender people just by letting them be in a supportive environment](https://www.childtrends.org/blog/research-shows-the-risk-of-misgendering-transgender-youth). To achieve this, calling them by their chosen name and using the pronouns they want to is needed.

2. This quote will explain the rest:

> “It’s important to use gender-neutral terms whenever you are referring to something that includes both men and women or could be done by either a man or a woman because it is the most accurate description of reality."
