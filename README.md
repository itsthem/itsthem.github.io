## Who are we?

<p align="justify">We're a group of people dedicated to removing gendered language from open-source projects.</p>

### Why?

<p align="justify">It is important to be inclusive to non-binary people and those who prefer different pronouns. Research shows that it is possible to heavily <a title="Research Shows the Risk of Misgendering Transgender Youth" href="https://www.childtrends.org/blog/research-shows-the-risk-of-misgendering-transgender-youth">decrease the suicide rates of transgender people by letting them be in a supportive environment</a>. To achieve this, calling them by their chosen name and using their preferred pronouns is required.</p>

<p align="justify">It is also important to recognize that males aren't the only people who can code. The under-representation of other genders can be discouraging to a young programmer new to the industry. Diversity makes us stronger, so we should do a better job in acknowledging and embracing our differences.</p>

<p align="justify">This quote from Dr. Rachael Tatman sums it up nicely:</p>

> <p align="justify">"Itâ€™s important to use gender-neutral terms whenever you are referring to something that includes both men and women or could be done by either a man or a woman because it is the most accurate description of reality."</p>

## How can I help?

<p align="justify">You can contact one of the people behind the project by email: contact (dot) zygoid (at) aleeas (dot) com.</p>

## Oh, so you're these people who get mad over words like "blacklist"? I want to send you death threats!

Nah, not really, to a certain extent. Non-inclusive pronouns in software (and other places) are a thing that someone can genuinely feel bad about. Keep in mind that all members of this organisation have different beliefs and opinions.

As for the death threats, sure! We love to receive them. See our email address above.
